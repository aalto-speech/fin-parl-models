## Locale

utils/validate_data_dir.sh    Changed LC_ALL on line 129 from "C.UTF-8" to "fi_FI.utf8" because Triton doesn't have "C.UTF-8".

Triton's current operating system is CentOS 7 which does not have C.UTF-8 support. Next version though, CentOS 8, should
have the support so when Triton is updated, this edit can be removed.
